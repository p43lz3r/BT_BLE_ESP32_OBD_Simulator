## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **üî¥ Classic BT Connection Issues**

**Problem**: Can't connect to simulator with phone/app
```
This is EXPECTED behavior due to ESP32 Classic BT limitations:

Root Causes:
- ESP32 Classic BT driver instability
- Incompatible Bluetooth stack versions  
- Device-specific compatibility issues
- SPP profile implementation problems

Solutions to Try:
1. Test with multiple different devices
2. Clear Bluetooth cache on phone
3. Restart both ESP32 and client device
4. Try older Android devices (often work better)
5. Switch to BLE mode instead
6. Use a different ESP32 board
7. Accept that it may simply not work reliably

‚ö†Ô∏è If Classic BT doesn't work: This is normal - use BLE instead!
```

**Problem**: Frequent disconnections during data transfer
```
This is a KNOWN ESP32 Classic BT issue:

Symptoms:
- Connection drops every few minutes
- "Connection lost" errors in apps
- ELMduino timeouts and reconnection attempts
- Inconsistent response times

Workarounds:
1. Implement robust reconnection logic in your app
2. Reduce data request frequency
3. Monitor connection health continuously
4. Have fallback procedures for disconnections
5. Consider this normal behavior, not a bug

Better Solution:
- Switch to BLE mode for reliable operation
```

**Problem**: ELMduino won't connect or times out
```
ELMduino + ESP32 Classic BT = Known problematic combination

Common Issues:
- begin() function times out
- nb_rx_state stuck in ELM_GETTING_MSG
- Random connection failures
- Memory leaks causing crashes

Solutions:
1. Increase timeout: elm.begin(SerialBT, true, 10000)
2. Add connection retry logic
3. Monitor nb_rx_state for failures
4. Restart ESP32 if connection fails multiple times
5. Use our ESP32-S3 BLE Client instead
```

### **‚úÖ BLE Connection Issues (Usually Simple Fixes)**

**Problem**: Can't find "OBD2_Simulator_BLE" device
```
Solutions:
1. Ensure ESP32 is powered and running
2. Check serial monitor for "BLE advertising started"
3. Use BLE scanner app to verify device is advertising
4. Check device name in code matches exactly
5. Clear BLE cache and restart scanning
```

**Problem**: BLE connects but no data received
```
Solutions:
1. Verify you're using Nordic UART Service UUIDs
2. Check that notifications are enabled on RX characteristic
3. Ensure commands end with \r (carriage return)
4. Monitor serial output for command processing
5. Try basic commands first (ATI, 010C)
```

### **‚ö° Performance Issues**

**Problem**: Slow response times on Classic BT
```
Expected Behavior:
- Classic BT: 50ms - 5000ms (highly variable)
- BLE: 20ms - 100ms (consistent)

This variation is normal for ESP32 Classic BT.

Optimizations:
1. Reduce command frequency
2. Implement command queuing
3. Monitor response times and adapt
4. Switch to BLE for consistent performance
```

**Problem**: Memory leaks or crashes over time
```
Known ESP32 Classic BT issue:

Symptoms:
- ESP.getFreeHeap() decreases over time
- Watchdog timer resets
- Random reboots during operation

Solutions:
1. Monitor heap usage: Serial.println(ESP.getFreeHeap())
2. Restart ESP32 periodically (every few hours)
3. Implement heap monitoring and auto-restart
4. Use BLE mode which doesn't have these issues
```

### **üîß Development Issues**

**Problem**: Compilation errors
```
Solutions:
1. Use original ESP32 board (not S3/C3/C6)
2. Ensure all files are in correct directories
3. Check PlatformIO board configuration
4. Clear build cache and rebuild
5. Verify ESP32 Arduino core version compatibility
```

**Problem**: Simulator starts but no Bluetooth advertising
```
Check Serial Monitor Output:
‚úÖ "Bluetooth Classic ready: OBD2_Simulator_Dual"
‚úÖ "BLE ready: OBD2_Simulator_BLE"  
‚úÖ "DUAL-MODE SIMULATOR READY!"

If missing, check:
1. Power supply is adequate (500mA+)
2. No other BT devices interfering
3. ESP32 board has working Bluetooth
4. Antenna connections (if using external)
```
